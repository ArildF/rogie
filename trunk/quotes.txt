If man, as the existentialist conceives him, is indefinable, it is because at first he is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be.

My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race. I cannot, however, deny that it has made some contributions to civilization. It helped in early days to fix the calendar, and it caused Egyptian priests to chronicle eclipses with such care that in time they became able to predict them.

More recent developments in paper-based technology include improved `write-once' update devices which use tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to deposit colored pigment.

All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal.

"I hadn't looked at it like that," he said, "But you're absolutely right. He's really pushed back the boundaries of ignorance."	Discworld scientists at work (Terry Pratchett, Equal Rites)
The computer was conceived as a tool to reduce complexity. Some people found this loss of complexity unacceptable, and developed UNIX to reintroduce it.
Curiously enough, the volume of interest and public debate is often inversely proportional to the importance of a feature. The reason is that it is much easier to have a firm opinion on a minor feature than on a major one; minor features fit directly into the current state of affairs, whereas major ones - by definition - do not.	Bjarne Stroustrup
I see the internet comes on computers these days.... 	Homer Simpson
The Devil's greatest accomplishment was the invention of religion
If you have any trouble sounding condescending, find a Unix user to show you how it's done. 	Scott Adams

Frank Zappa

If God dropped acid, would he see people?	Stephen Wright
If he [god] is wise, why did he not compose a coherent account of what he wanted mankind to do? No, the Bible is not such an account; nobody can agree in what it says. The very god who, according to those who believe in him, made every last electron spin in its orbit everywhere throughout the universe, still cannot write a clear, unmistakable volume of instructions to human beings who are supposed to follow his wishes, Instead, he allegedly gives us the Bible or Koran, or some other jumble of ridiculous and ancient superstitions...	Fred Woodworth

Do you want real TRUTH in capital letters? Then search yourself for why you believe the things you do. Don't be afraid to analyze why your religion gives you the high it does. Answer yourself this question: Is TRUTH important enough for me to give up my religion if that is required? Until you answer yes to this you are not being honest with yourself.	Dave Trissel
I believe Christ was a man like ourselves; to look upon him as God would seem to me the greatest of sacrileges	Leo Tolstoy

Let a wave of intolerance wash over you. I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you. Yes, hate is good.... If a Christian voted for Clinton, he sinned against God. It's that simple.... Our goal is a Christian Nation... we have a biblical duty, we are called by God to conquer this country. We don't want equal time. We don't want Pluralism. We want theocracy.

There is no such source and cause of strife, quarrel, fights, malignant opposition, persecution, and war, and all evil in the state, as religion.

District Board, March 18, 1890

Thank you, but I'm afraid I can't accept your compliment. You see, I'm an atheist, so if I'm also God, that would mean that I don't believe in myself, and at this point in my life, I don't need the added insecurity.	J Michael Straczynski, when told by a fan that he was God

To kill a man is not to defend a doctrine, but to kill a man.	Michael Servetus
Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains people as to how they shall think.	Arthur Schopenhauer
Consider, for example, the Koran. This wretched book was sufficient to found a religion of the world, to satisfy the metaphysical need of innumerable millions of men for twelve hundred years, to become the foundation of their morality, and of no small contempt for death, and also to inspire them to bloody wars and most extended conquests.	Schopenhauer
A healthy nature needs no God or immortality.	Johann Schiller
God is dead. Let us not understand by this that he does not exist or even that he no longer exists. He is dead. He spoke to us and is silent. We no longer have anything but his cadaver. Perhaps he slipped out of the world, somewhere else like the soul of a dead man. Perhaps he was only a dream...God is dead.	Sartre
For Shakespeare, in the matter of religion, the choice lay between Christianity and nothing. He chose nothing.
The Bible is a wonderful source of inspiration for those who don't understand it.	George Santayana
Two recent surveys rate the United States at the top among Western nations in belief in God and at the bottom among six major countries in school kids' understanding of science and math. This could be dismissed as chance, but it shouldn't be. While our economic competitors' schools are teaching students advanced math and science, many of our schools are wasting energy debating whether to teach evolution or creationism, which maintains that God created the universe over a six-day period about 6,000 years ago.	Bill Mandel
He posted no brief in defense or mitigation of his offenses, and when he was most solemnly advised by the Court President of the dire consequences he faced if found guilty, Juan Damasceno volunteered only one comment: It will mean I do not go to the Christian heaven?' He was told that that would indeed be the worst of his punishments:that he would most assuredly not go to Heaven. At which, his smile sent a thrill of horror through every soul of the Court." "Aztec" - Gary Jennings
Religion is a monumental chapter in the history of human egotism.	William James (1842-1910)

Fear believes -- courage doubts. Fear falls upon the earth and prays -- courage stands erect and thinks. Fear is barbarism -- courage is civilization. Fear believes in witchcraft, in devils and in ghosts. Fear is religion, courage is science.	Robert G Ingersoll
As long as man believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master. The civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of unbelief -- the result of free thought.	Robert G Ingersoll
The book, called the Bible, is filled with passages equally horrible, unjust and atrocious. This is the book to be read in schools in order to make our children loving, kind and gentle! This is the book they wish to be recognized in our Constitution as the source of all authority and justice!	Ingersoll
Nothing is so pleasing to these gods as the butchery of unbelievers. Nothing so enrages them, even now, as to have someone deny their existence.	Ingersoll
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so	Douglas Adams
Ford, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it.
If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.
In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were REAL men, women were REAL women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were REAL small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.
In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.	Douglas Adams
The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.

We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them.' The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford.`Stick it up your nose,' he said.`Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,' insisted the girl, `Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?'
Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much... the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely the dolphins believed themselves to be more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons.	Douglas Adams
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexeplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.	Douglas Adams
My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre, and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes.
Anything that happens, happens. Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, causes itself to happen again. It doesn't all necessarily happen chronologically, though.	Douglas Adams
God's final message to Creation: Sorry for the inconvenience.	Douglas Adams
I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls.	Albert Einstein
God does not play dice with the universe: He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players,* to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with balcnk cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.	Neil Gaiman/Terry Pratchett
Lord, protect me from your followers!
I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth	Thomas 
The knack of flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.	Douglas Adams
You barbarians! I'll sue the council for every penny it's got! I'l have you hung, drawn, and quartered! And whipped! And boiled...until...until...until you've had enough. And then I will do it again! And when I've finished I will take all the little bits, and I will JUMP on them! And I will carry on jumping on them until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do...	Arthur Dent
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.	The Guide
God made me an atheist. Who are you to question his wisdom?
I reverse the phrase of Voltaire, and say that if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.	Michael Bakunin
It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, "mad cow" disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.	Richard Dawkins
This would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no [organized] religion in it	John Adams
I do not see how it is possible for an intelligent human being to conclude that the Song of Solomon is the work of God, and that the tragedy of Lear was the work of an uninspired man.	Robert Ingersoll
We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.	Gene Roddenberry
My spell-checker lacks the word 'creationism' in its dictionary, so each time that word is encountered, an alternative pops up at the bottom of my screen, 'cretinism'	E.T. Babinski
Jesus' last words on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" hardly seem like the words of a man who planned it that way. It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure there is something wrong here.	Donald Morgan
But a short time elapsed after the death of the great reformer of the Jewish religion, before his principles were departed from by those who professed to be his special servants, and perverted into an engine for enslaving mankind, and aggrandizing their oppressors in Church and State.	Thomas Jefferson
...any belief in supernatural creators, rulers, or influencers of natural or human process introduces an irreparable split into the universe, and prevents us from grasping its real unity. Any belief in Absolutes, whether the absolute validity of moral commandments, of authority of revelation, of inner certitudes, or of divine inspiration, erects a formidable barrier against progress and the responsibility of improvement, moral, rational, and religious.	Julian Huxley
To assert that the earth revolves around the sun is as erroneous as to claim that Jesus was not born of a virgin.	Cardinal Bellarmine
I do think the Roman Catholic religion is a disease of the mind which has a particular epidemiology similar to that of a virus... Religion is a terrific meme. That's right. But that doesn't make it true and I care about what's true. Smallpox virus is a terrific virus. It does its job magnificently well. That doesn't mean that it's a good thing. It doesn't mean that I don't want to see it stamped out.	Richard Dawkins
Religion is fundamentally opposed to everything I hold in veneration--courage, clear thinking, honesty, fairness, and, above all, love of the truth.	Henry Louis Mencken
The sense of spiritual relief, which comes from rejecting the idea of God as a supernatural being, is enormous.	Julian Huxley
Take from the church the miraculous, the supernatural, the incomprehensible, the unreasonable, the impossible, the unknowable, the absurd, and nothing but a vacuum remains.	Robert G Ingersoll
There are none more ignorant and useless, than they that seek answers on their knees, with their eyes closed
Several thousand years ago, a small tribe of ignorant near-savages wrote various collections of myths, wild tales, lies, and gibberish. Over the centuries, these stories were embroidered, garbled, mutilated, and torn into small pieces that were then repeatedly shuffled. Finally, this material was badly translated into several languages successively. The resultant text, creationists feel, is the best guide to this complex and technical subject.
Christian Fundamentalism: The doctrine that there is an absolutely powerful, infinitely knowledgeable, universe spanning entity that is deeply and personally concerned about my sex life.
'God is as real as I am', the old man said. I was relieved since I knew Santa wouldn't lie to me...
Anyone who engages in the practice of psychotherapy confronts every day the devastation wrought by the teachings of religion.	Nathaniel Branden, Ph.D
For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone- written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.	Charles Bukowski
Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of 10 things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these 10 things he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry for ever and ever until the end of time...but he loves you.	George Carlin
When a man ceases to believe in god, he does not believe in nothing. He believes in everything.	G.K Chesterton
I've been reading an Alabama newspaper that one man shot another man because he beat him in a Bible-quoting competition.
I believe the spreading of Catholicism to be the most horrible means of political and social degradation left in the world.	Charles Dickens
Asked soon after Carl's death: "Didn't [Sagan] want to believe?" She responded, "He didn't want to believe. He wanted to  know."	Carl Sagan's wife Ann Druyan
The gods can either take away evil from the world and will not, or, being willing to do so, cannot; or they neither can nor will, or lastly, they are both able and willing. If they have the will to remove evil and cannot, then they are not omnipotent. If they can, but will not, than they are not benevolent. If they are neither able nor willing, then they are neither omnipotent nor benevolent. Lastly, if they are both able and willing to annihilate evil, how does it exist?	Epicures
If 50 million people believe a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing	Anatole France
In the long run nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction religion offers to both is only too palpable.	Sigmund Freud
Randomness scares people. Religion is a way to explain randomness.	Fran Lebowitz

The only force more devastating than a nuclear holocaust is a group of Christians fresh out of church.	Matt Polek
It is an interesting and demonstrable fact, that all children are atheists and were religion not inculcated into their minds, they would remain so.	Ernestine Rose
This above all: to thine own self be true.	Polonius(Hamlet)
It's an incredible con job when you think about it, to believe something now in exchange for something after death. Even corporations with their reward systems don't try to make it posthumous.	Gloria Steinem
Truth in matters of religion is simply the opinion that has survived.	Oscar Wilde
Fundamentalists are like the fir trees in German forests: they cannot stand alone, and are only stable when crowded together, branches locked with those of their brothers. That is why we must always fear them, because they will always hate us for our individualism.	Brent Yaciw
Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.	Thomas Jefferson
During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution.	James Madison
Our Bible reveals to us the character of our god with minute and remorseless exactness... It is perhaps the most damnatory biography that exists in print anywhere. It makes Nero an angel of light and leading by contrast	Mark Twain
O Lord our God, help us tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it...	Mark Twain
Man is a marvelous curiosity ... he thinks he is the Creator's pet ... he even believes the Creator loves him; has a passion for him; sits up nights to admire him; yes and watch over him and keep him out of trouble. He prays to him and thinks He listens. Isn't it a quaint idea.	Mark Twain
If there is a God, he is a malign thug.	Mark Twain
It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.	Albert Einstein
If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?	Albert Einstein
During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution, human fantasy created gods in man's own image who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate influence, the phenomenal world... The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old conception of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes... In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vase power in the hands of priests.	Albert Einstein
All thinking men are atheists	Ernest Hemingway
I condemn false prophets, I condemn the effort to take away the power of rational decision, to drain people of their free will--and a hell of a lot of money in the bargain. Religions vary in their degree of idiocy, but I reject them all. For most people, religion is nothing more than a substitute for a malfunctioning brain.	Gene Roddenberry
It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God, but to create him.	Arthur C Clarke
I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.	Susan B Anthony
Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.	Benjamin Franklin
No man who ever lived knows any more about the hereafter ... than you and I; and all religion ... is simply evolved out of chicanery, fear, greed, imagination and poetry.	Edgar Allan Poe
Of all religions the Christian is without doubt the one which should inspire tolerance most, although up to now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.	Voltaire
Christianity is the most ridiculous, the most absurd and bloody religion that has ever infected the world.	Voltaire
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?	Epicurus
Christ was only crucified once, and for a few hours. Think of the thousands he has been crucifying in a quiet way ever since	Samuel Butler
Men will never be free until the last king is strangled in the entrails of the last priest.	Denis Diderot
The Christian religion teaches us to imitate a God that is cruel, insidious, jealous, and implacable in his wrath.	Denis Diderot
Religion is too important a matter to its devotees to be a subject of ridicule. If they indulge in absurdities, they are to be pitied rather than ridiculed.	Immanuel Kant
No kingdom has ever suffered as many civil wars as the kingdom of Christ.	Baron de Montesquieu
Atheism is the vice of a few intelligent people.	Voltaire
Every sensible man, every honest man, must hold the Christian sect in horror. But what shall we substitute in it's place? you say. What? A ferocious animal has sucked the blood of my relatives. I tell you to rid yourselves of this beast, and you ask me what you shall put in it's place?	Voltaire
If a man would follow, today, the teachings of the Old Testament, he would be a criminal. If he would follow strictly the teachings of the New, he would be insane.	Robert G Ingersoll
The hands that help are better far than the lips that pray.	Robert G Ingersoll
In this "sacred" book of family scandals we find filth, sex orgies, cannibalism, atrocities, sex perversions, incest, bloody violence unparalleled in any other chronicle in all the literature of the world. Fortunately, not one- third of the human family has ever heard of the Christian Bible; not one-tenth of the Christians have ever read it, and no two who have read it agree as to its meaning. Won't you help get this book out of the hands of our children, out of decent homes, and out of hotel and motel rooms? 	Frank C Hughes
If God lived on earth, people would break his windows.	Jewish proverb
Christian: I'll pray for you. Atheist: Then I'll think for both of us.
I think therefore I'm dangerous
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.	Thomas Paine
The god of the Bible measures up to the level of a petty and vicious tyrant. The god of the bible punishes babies for the sins of their parents (Exodus 20:5, 34:7; Numbers 14:18; 2 Samuel 12:13-19); punishes people by causing them to become cannibals and eat their children (2 Kings 6:24-33, Lamentations 4:10-11); gives people bad laws, even requiring the sacrifice of their firstborn babies, so that they can be filled with horror and know that god is their lord (Ezekiel 20:25-26); causes people to believe lies so that he can send them to hell (2 Thessalonians 2:11), and many other atrocities, far too many to list here. It would not be hard to measure up to, and exceed, that level of moral purity. Atheists surpass it every day.	Doug Krueger
If you think your belief is based upon reason, you will support it by argument rather than by persecution, and will abandon it if the argument goes against you. But if your belief is based upon faith, you will realize that argument is useless, and will therefore resort to force either in the form of persecution or by stunting or distorting the minds of the young in what is called 'education.'	Bertrand Russell
I do not pretend to know what many ignorant men are sure -- that is all agnosticism means.	Clarence Darrow
Cabalistic Christianity, which is Catholic Christianity, and which has prevailed for 1,500 years, has received a mortal wound, of which the monster must finally die. Yet so strong is his constitution, that he may endure for centuries before he expires.	John Adams
Forgive, O Lord, any little jokes on Thee, and I'll forgive Thy great big one on me.	Robert Frost
Naturally, since [the Sumerians] didn't know what caused the flood anymore than we do, they blamed the gods.  (That's the advantage of religion. You're never short an explanation for anything.)	Isaac Asimov
No actual tyrant known to history has ever been guilty of one-hundredth of the crimes, massacres, and other atrocities attributed to the Deity in the Bible.	Steve Allen
The essence of Christianity is told us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is, All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and hadn't asked any questions.	Frank Zappa
The Lord slew Onan, and to this day the Christian world cannot understand why he stopped with Onan, instead of slaying all the inhabitants for three hundred miles around -- they being innocent of offense, and therefore the very ones he would usually slay. For that had always been his idea of fair dealing. If he had had a motto, it would have read, 'Let no innocent person escape.'	Mark Twain
It is impossible that there should be inhabitants on the opposite side of the Earth, since no such race is recorded by Scripture among the descendants of Adam.	St. Augustine
Women should not be enlightened or educated in any way. They should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of hideous and involuntary erections in holy men.	St. Augustine
The good Christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who make empty prophecies. The danger already exists that mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine man in the bonds of Hell.	St. Augustine
We all know that those who instigate those doubts are the enemies of God, the enemies of religion and the enemies of all humanity. Their hearts are full of hatred.	The comment of the Justice Minister of Saudi Arabia to the Amnesty reports on the country's human rights record
The Christian glories in the death of a pagan, because thereby Christ himself is glorified.	St Bernard of Clairvaux
If we have to give up either religion or education, we should give up education.	William Jennings Bryan
I will never apologize for the United States of America - I don't care what the facts are.	George Bush, commenting on the killing of 290 passengers shot down by the USS Vincennes
Every woman should be filled with shame by the thought that she is a woman.	St. Clement of Alexandria
The truth is that nowhere on the face of the earth, in all of time, were servants better treated or better loved than they were in the Old South by white, black, Hispanic and Indian slave owners.	Senator Charles Davidson, Alabama R
The less we think or know about hygiene, the less we are predisposed to sickness	Mary Baker Eddy
The AIDs virus also discriminates on religious or political views. Those people who are liberals, or atheist, or agnostic, or buy into "new age" anything goes, are at high risk of getting AIDs and dying.	Bob Enyart
The little child is in this red hot oven. Hear how it screams to come out. See how it turns and twists itself about in the fire. It beats its head against the roof of the oven. It stamps its little feet on the floor of the oven. You can see on the face of this little child what you see on the faces of all in hell - despair, desperate and horrible! The same law which is for others is also for children. If children, knowingly and willingly, break God's commandments, they must also be punished like others. This child committed very bad mortal sins, knowing well the harm of what it was doing, and knowing that hell would be the punishment. God was very good to this child. Very likely God saw that this child would get worse and worse, and would never repent, and so it would have to be punished much more in hell. So God, in His mercy, called it out of the world in its early childhood.	Father John Furniss
We should always be disposed to believe that that which appears white is really black, if the hierarchy of the Church so decides.	Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits
A woman should endure any violence or torture imposed on her by her husband for she is fully at his disposal. Without his permission she may not leave her house even for a good action (such as charitable work). Otherwise her prayers and devotions will not be accepted by God and curses of heaven and earth will fall upon her.	Hojatoleslam Imani
Killing is a form of mercy because it rectifies the person. Sometimes a person cannot be reformed unless he is cut up and burnt. ... You must kill, burn and lock up those in opposition.	Ayatollah Khomeini
Read the Bible. It teaches you how to act. Read the hymn book. It contains the finest poetry ever written. Read the almanac. It shows you how to figure out what the weather will be. There isn't another book that is necessary for anyone to read, and therefore I am opposed to all libraries.	Hal Kimberly, Georgia legislator
It should be made clear that in order to live a Christian life, any Christian must be able to discriminate and hate, because that's what the bible says.	Bernhard Piper, Colorado Springs pastor
Reason should be destroyed in all Christians.	Martin Luther
The word and works of God is quite clear, that women were made either to be wives or prostitutes.	Martin Luther
Make short work with heretics, they can be condemned unheard. And while they are burning at the stake, the faithful should destroy the evil root and branch and bathe his hands in the blood of the bishops and the pope who is the devil in disguise.	Martin Luther
To embrace a woman is to embrace a sack of manure...	St. Odo of Cluny
It was once proposed that all religions persuasions should be free and their worship publicly exercised. We Catholics have rejected this article as contrary to Roman Catholic canon law	Pope Pius VII
It is a just retribution for improper sexual conduct. [on AIDS] 	Mother Teresa
By fearing whom I trust I find my way to truth; by trusting wholly I betray the trust of wisdom; better far is doubt which brings the false into the light of day.	Al-Ma'arri, Syrian poet
Hanifs [Muslims] are stumbling, Christians all astray Jews wildered, Magians far on error's way. We mortals are composed of two great schools: Enlightened knaves or else religious fools.	Al-Ma'arri, Syrian Poet
Shrines! Shrines! Surely you don't believe in the gods. What's your argument? Where's your proof?	Aristophanes
Men create gods after their own image, not only with regard to their form but with regard to their mode of life.	Aristotle
I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse.	Isaac Asimov
The fundamentalists deny that evolution has taken place; they deny that the earth and the universe as a whole are more than a few thousand years old, and so on. There is ample scientific evidence that the fundamentalists are wrong in these matters, and that their notions of cosmogony have about as much basis in fact as the Tooth Fairy has.	Isaac Asimov
It is precisely because it is fashionable for Americans to know no science, even though they may be well educated otherwise, that they so easily fall prey to nonsense. They thus become part of the armies of the night, the purveyors of nitwittery, the retailers of intellectual junk food, the feeders on mental cardboard, for their ignorance keeps them from distinguishing nectar from sewage. 	Isaac Asimov
Imagine the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore, totally, all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written. And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes.	Isaac Asimov
The opinion of 10,000 men is of no value if none of them know anything about the subject.	Marcus Aurelius
What happens when the same number of people pray for something as pray against it? How does God decide whose prayer to answer? Does the total number of people praying for or against something matter? How about the righteousness of the supplicants? Are positive prayers answered more frequently than negative ones? Does God take the positive ones and Satan the negative? Does the intensity of the praying have any effect on the outcome? Does the length of time one devotes to praying have any effect on the frequency with which one's prayers are answered? Do the words and phrases used in the prayer - either positive or negative - have any bearing on the success rate? Does the nature of the thing or things prayed for have any bearing on the prayer's success rate - either positive or negative prayers? Why or why not?	Robert A Baker
Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.	James Baldwin
You can cite a hundred references to show that the biblical God is a bloodthirsty tyrant, but if they can dig up two or three verses that say "God is love" they will claim that you are taking things out of context!	Dan Barker
Truth does not demand belief. Scientists do not join hands every Sunday, singing, "yes, gravity is real! I will have faith! I will be strong! I believe in my heart thatwhat goes up, up, up must come down, down. down. Amen!" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about it.	Dan Baker
I do not know that Christianity holds anything more of importance for the world. It is finished, played out. The only trouble lies in how to get rid of the body before it begins to smell too much. 	John Beevers
Heathen. A benighted creature who has the folly to worship something he can see and feel. 	Ambrose Bierce
Pray. To ask the laws of the universe to be annulled on behalf of a single petitioner confessedly unworthy.	Ambrose Bierce
Faith. Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel.	Ambrose Bierce
The Christian Right always needs scapegoats, and the rise of AIDS since the mid-eighties has made a convenient scapegoat of anyone whose sexuality encompasses more than breeding in the missionary position.	Poppy Z Brite
Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do not believe in anything because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with  reason, and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, accept it and live up to it.	Buddha
The more I read about man and his maniacal ruthlessness and his murderous envious scatological soul, the more I realize that he will never change. Our stupidity is immortal, nothing will change it. The same mistakes, the same prejudices, the same injustice, the same lusts wheel endlessly around the parade ground of the centuries. Immutable and ineluctable. I wish I could believe in a god of some kind but I simply cannot	Richard Burton
Belief like any other moving body follows the path of least resistance.	Samuel Butler
Prayers are to men as dolls are to children. They are not without use and comfort, but it is not easy to take them seriously.	Samuel Butler
I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's there for me every day, and the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to 'God' are all answered at about the same 50% rate.	George Carlin
Ok, you win. You proved that your god it the best there ever was at hide'n'seek. Now, trot him out here so that we can give him his reward.	Dan Ceppa
We were brought up to fear, to fear, to fear. To fear the nuns, to fear God, to fear the Devil. We were never taught to love or given any love. I suffered physical abuse, mental abuse, psychological abuse and spiritual abuse.	Maggie Chapman, survivor of church orphanage
I would defend the liberty of concenting adult creationists to practice whatever intellectual perversions they like in the privacy of their own homes; but it is also necessary to protect the young and innocent.	Arthur C Clarke
Religion is a by-product of fear. For much of human history, it may have been a necessary evil, but why was it more evil than necessary? Isn't killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity?	Arthur C Clarke
The religionists apologize that although the Bible was inspired by God, it was, unfortunately, written by ancient, ignorant, half-civilized people.	C.W.Dalton
Just think of the tragedy of teaching children not to doubt.	Clarence Darrow
I am an Agnostic because I am not afraid to think. I am not afraid of any god in the universe who would send me or any other man or woman to hell. If there were such a being, he would not be a god; he would be a devil.	Clarence Darrow
Do you, good people, believe that Adam and Eve were created in the Garden of Eden and that they were forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge? I do. The church has always been afraid of that tree. It still is afraid of knowledge. Some of you say religion makes people happy. So does laughing gas. So does whiskey. I believe in the brain of man. I'm not worried about my soul.	Clarence Darrow
I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world.	Richard Dawkins
Faith is powerful enough to immunize people against all appeals to pity, to forgiveness, to decent human feelings. It even immunizes them against fear, if they honestly believe that a martyr's death will send them straight to heaven. What a weapon! Religious faith deserves a chapter to itself in the annals of war technology, on an even footing with the longbow, the warhorse, the tank, and the hydrogen bomb. 	Richard Dawkins
Blind faith can justify anything. In a man believes in a different god, or even if he uses a different ritual for worshipping the same god, blind faith can decree that he should die - on the cross, at the stake, skewered on a Crusader's sword, shot in a Beirut street, or blown up in a bar in Belfast. Memes for blind faith have their own ruthless ways of propagating themselves. This is true of patriotic and political as well as religious blind faith	Richard Dawkins
The Judaical and Christian theology show us a partial god who chooses or rejects, who loves or hates, according to his caprice; in short, a tyrant who plays with his creatures; who punishes in this world the whole human species for the crimes of a single man; who predestines the greater number of mortals to be his enemies, to the end that he may punish them to all eternity, for having received from him the liberty of declaring against him.	Denis Diderot
An Inuit hunter asked the local missionary priest: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?" "No," said the priest, "not if you did not know." "Then why," asked the Inuit earnestly, "did you tell me?"	Annie Dillard
When I look upon seamen, men of physical science, and philosophers, man is the wisest of all beings. When I look upon priests, prophets, and interpreters of dreams, nothing is so contemptible as man.	Diogenes
I continue to be bemused by women fighting for the right to be xtian priests. The whole religion and its textbooks are so sexist that it seems as mad as a jew fighting for the right to join a nazi party.	John Drayton, alt.atheism
He who will not reason, is a bigot; He who cannot, is a fool; And he who dares not, is a slave.	William Drummond
The idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I am unable to take seriously. 	Albert Einstein
I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance - but for us, not for God.	Albert Einstein
Parsons always seem to be specially horrified about things like sunbathing and naked bodies. They don't mind poverty and misery and cruelty to animals nearly as much.	Susan Ertz
Religion stills a thinking mind.	Greg Erwin
Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, "Some gardener must tend this plot." The other disagrees, "There is no gardener." So, they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener... So they set up a barbed wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol it with bloodhounds... But no shrieks even suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. "But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves." At last the Skeptic despairs, "But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even no gardener at all?"
I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely above it.	Benjamin Franklin
Once a doctrine, however irrational, has gained power in a society, millions of people will believe it rather than feel ostracized and isolated.	Erich Fromm
Man is forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He acts against God's command... From the standpoint of the Church, which represents authority, this is essentially sin. From the standpoint of man, however, this is the beginning of human freedom.	Erich Fromm
I think that in the discussion of natural problems we ought to begin not with the Scriptures, but with experiments, and demonstrations. 	Galileo Galilei
The most heinous and the most cruel crimes of which history has record have been committed under the cover of religion or equally noble motives.	Gandhi
Christianity, above all, consoles; but there are naturally happy souls who do not need consolation. Consequently, Christianity begins by making such souls unhappy, for otherwise it would have no power over them.	André Gide
Christianity is most admirably adapted to the training of slaves, to the perpetuation of a slave society.	Emma Goldman
Christ and his teachings are the embodiment of submission, of inertia, of the denial of life; hence responsible for the things done in their name.	Emma Goldman
We Americans claim to be a peace-loving people. We hate bloodshed; we are opposed to violence. Yet we go into spasms of joy over the possibility of projecting dynamite bombs from flying machines upon helpless citizens. We are ready to hang, electrocute, or lynch anyone, who, from economic necessity, will risk his own life in the attempt upon that of some industrial magnate. Yet our hearts swell with pride at the thought that America is becoming the most powerful nation on earth, and that it will eventually plant her iron foot on the necks of all other nations. Such is the logic of patriotism.	Emma Goldman
Christians tell me that they have a higher destiny than the lower animals, because Homo Sapiens can reason. But the Bible tells me that this gift of reason, which they call god-given, may be the match that lights the fires of hell for all who dare to use it, since whatever is not of faith is sin. 	Ruth Hurmence Green
Suppose you had never heard of Christianity, and that next Sunday morning a stranger standing in a pulpit told you about a book whose authors could not be authenticated and whose contents, written hundreds of years ago, included blood-curdling legends of slaughter and intrigue and fables about unnatural happenings such as virgin births, devils that inhabit bodies and talk, people rising from the dead and ascending live into the clouds, and suns that stand still. Suppose he then asked you to believe that an uneducated man described in that book was a god who could get you into an eternal fantasy-place called heaven, when you die. Would you as an intelligent rational person even bother to read such nonsense, let alone pattern your entire life upon it?	Ruth Hurmence Green
Heresy is only another word for freedom of thought. 	Graham Greene
I am treated as evil by people who claim that they are being oppressed because they are not allowed to force me to practice what they do.	D.Dale Gulledge
We must conduct research and then accept the results. If they don't stand up to experimentation, Buddha's own words must be rejected.	Tenzin Gyatso(the Dalai Lama)
Jesus is just a word I use to swear with.	Richard Harris
I understand prayer quite well. It's a masturbatory exercise that gives catharsis to the pray-er and a placebo effect to the pray-ee, but only if the pray-ee knows he's being prayed for.	John Hattan
If we are going to teach "creation science" as an alternative to evolution, then we should also teach the stork theory as an alternative to biological reproduction. 	Judith Hayes
All religions have based morality on obedience, that is to say, on voluntary slavery. That is why they have always been more pernicious than any political organization. For the latter makes use of violence. the former - of the corruption of the will.	Alexander Herzen
Take away hatred from some people, and you have men without faith.	Erich Hoffer
To know a person's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance.	Erich Hoffer
All children are atheists - they have no idea of God. 	Baron d'Holbach
Organized religion, being founded on superstition, is, perforce, not scientific. And all that which is not scientific - that is, truthful - must be bolstered up by force, fear and falsehood. Thus we always find slavery and organized religion going hand in hand.	Elbert Hubbard
There is in every village a torch: the schoolmaster - and an extinguisher: the priest.	Victor Hugo
Morality is always the product of terror; its chains and strait-waistcoats are fashioned by those who dare not trust others, because they dare not trust themselves, to walk in liberty.	Aldous Huxley
The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of those of Greece and Rome-not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world, were alike despicable.	Thomas Huxley
The inspiration of the Bible depends on the ignorance of the person who reads it. 	Robert Ingersoll
God so loved the world that he made up his mind to damn a large majority of the human race.	Robert Ingersoll
We are satisfied that there can be but little liberty on earth while men worship a tyrant in heaven.	Robert Ingersoll
As long as every question is answered by the word "God," scientific inquiry is simply impossible.	Robert Ingersoll
My objection to Christianity is that it is infinitely cruel, infinitely selfish, and, I might add, infinitely absurd.	Robert Ingersoll
This crime called blasphemy was invented by priests for the purpose of defending doctrines not able to take care of themselves.	Robert Ingersoll
The notion that faith in Christ is to be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason, observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for refutation, and can be believed only by that unhappy mixture of insanity and ignorance called "faith."	Robert Ingersoll
The real oppressor, enslaver, and corrupter of the people is the Bible. That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy. That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and schools. That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest investigation a crime. That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.	Robert Ingersoll
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.	Samuel Johnson
Few Christians would be in doubt what to think of a father tortured his children for forty-eight hours because they did not agree with him or did not obey him; and if he had a great many children and had given only a few of them a single chance while offering the vast majority no opportunity at all to know his will, most people would consider this the epitome of an inhuman lack of love and justice. The God of traditional Christianity, however, outdoes even this analogy by relegating the mass of mankind to eternal torment.	Walter Kaufmann
You think there is a magic pixie that came from nowhere, made the universe, then tortures people eternally for not believing in it, because it loves them? Does that sum it up?	Steve Knight
The fact is that far more crime and child abuse has been committed by zealots in the name of God, Jesus and Mohammed than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. Many people, including myself, don't like that statement, but the truth of it is undeniable.	Kenneth Lanning
The churches used to win their arguments against atheism, agnosticism, and other burning issues by burning the ismists, which is fine proof that there is a devil but hardly evidence that there is a God.	Ben Lindsey and Wainwright Evans
Fear was the first thing on earth to make gods.	Lucretius
All religions are equally sublime to the ignorant, useful to the politician, and ridiculous to the philosopher.	Lucretius

I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off. So I ran over and said, "Stop! don't do it!""Why shouldn't I?" he said.I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!"He said, "Like what?" I said, "Well... are you religious or atheist?" He said, "Religious." I said, "Me too! Are you Christian or Buddhist?" He said, "Christian." I said, "Me too! Are you Catholic or Protestant?" He said, "Protestant." I said, "Me too! Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?" He said, "Baptist!" I said, "Wow! Me too! Are you Baptist Church of God or Baptist Church of the Lord?" He said, "Baptist Church of God!" I said, "Me too! Are you original Baptist Church of God, or are you Reformed Baptist Church of God?" He said, "Reformed Baptist Church of God!" I said, "Me too! Are you Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1915?" He said, "Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1915!" I said, "Die, heretic scum!" and pushed him off.
When I was a kid, I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realized that the Lord, in his wisdom, didn't work that way. So I just stole one and asked him to forgive me.
Scientists have shown that the moon is moving away at a tiny yet measurable distance from the earth every year. If you do the math, you can calculate that 85 million years ago the moon was orbiting the earth at a distance of about 35 feet from the earth's surface. This would explain the death of the dinosaurs. The tallest ones, anyway.

The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris	Larry Wall
A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.	Douglas Adams
Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be.	Douglas AdamsFor a moment, nothing happened.Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen.	Douglas Adams
God puts an apple tree in the middle of the Garden of Eden and says, do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting "Gotcha." It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it... because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in the end.	Douglas Adams
I don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't believe it.	Douglas Adams
I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?	Douglas Adams
If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands.	Douglas Adams
INFINITE: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much bigger than that, in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, real "wow, that's big" time. Infinity is so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here.	Douglas Adams
Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?	Douglas Adams
It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.	Douglas Adams
It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.	Douglas Adams
Life... is like a grapefruit. It's orange and squishy, and has a few pips in it, and some folks have half a one for breakfast.	Douglas Adams
That young girl is one of the least benightedly unintelligent organic life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.	Douglas Adams
The difficulty with this conversation is that it's very different from most of the ones I've had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees.	Douglas Adams
The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.	Douglas Adams
The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phase, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?	Douglas Adams
The impossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbable lacks.	Douglas Adams
The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.	Douglas Adams
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.	Douglas Adams
Time, we know, is relative. You can travel light years through the stars and back, and if you do it at the speed of light then, when you return, you may have aged mere seconds while your twin brother or sister will have aged twenty, thirty, forty or however many years it is, depending on how far you traveled.This will come to you as a profound shock, particularly if you didn't know you had a twin brother or sister.	Douglas Adams
We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!	Douglas Adams
You live and learn. At any rate, you live.	Douglas Adams

I'm not a religious man. In fact, I consider myself a completely recovered Catholic (I've been clean and sober for more than a decade and I never feel the need to go back for another hit off the body of Christ)	Chris Sells
- To begin with, said the Cat, a dog's not mad. You grant that? I suppose so, said Alice. Well, then, - the Cat went on - you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.
As someone who made a living training and consulting with C++ for about 13 years, let me be about the 10^8 person to say that C++ was completely unsuitable for component developement. As someone that has quite a bit of architectural experience under my belt, I believe that it's completely impossible to assemble a large team of ordinary developers (people dumber than Chris Sells) and keep them marching in a straight line without a trail of memory leaks, access violations, and late nights when using C++.

To question Hiroshima is to explode a precious myth we all grow up with in this country - that America is different from the other imperial powers of the world, that other nations may commit unspeakable acts, but not ours.
And yet it is absolutely essential for our Political leaders to defend the bombing(of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) because if Americans can be induced to accept that then they can accept any war, any means, so long as the warmakers can supply a reason. And there are always plausible reasons delivered from on high as from Moses on the Mount.
General Eisenhower, briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson on the imminent use of the bomb, told him that "Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary.

Note to Java people:  I am a Java person.  I program Java almost every day, and I was developing in Java just a couple of  hours ago.  An "enterprise" language that provides no way to forceably kill a thread that had gone amuck, that provides no way to get the free space left on the local drive, that provides tools that make the VB IDE look attractive even now, and that can't produce a GUI that is up to the standards that VB set years ago, is not "industrial strength."

What I am against is quotas. I am against hard quotas. Quotas, they basically delineate based upon whatever. However they delineate; quotas, I think, vulcanize society.

The *avoidance* of delving beyond the scenes is what makes a superior programmer. A programmer should be able to read an interface specification, and then code to that specification without overly speculating about the behavior behind a given implementation of it. This skill comes into play not only in using an abstract programming language, but in constructing large software decomposed into cohesive, loosely-coupled blackboxes. If you write one module such that it is dependent on what is going on behind the scenes of another module, you have committed a programming mistake, no matter how clever your solution is or how many cycles it shaves off the execution.

Laughter means distance. Where laughter is absent, madness begins. The moment one takes the world with complete seriousness one is potentially insane. The whole art of learning to live means holding fast to laughter; without laughter the world is a torture chamber, a dark place where dark things will happen to us, a horror show filled with bloody deeds of violence.	Jens Bjørneboe
Take away the "immoral" criminal, and we'd be robbed of one of the lies we need in order to live: namely the belief that there is someone who is even more immoral than we are. We all need someone to despise and look down on as not having full value. This is another of our strong points of likeness with that same criminal: in prison there always develops a hierarchical type of society, where the safecracker and the gunman rank highest and the sexual offender lowest. The prison is a true copy of our own society.	Jens Bjørneboe

To rebel against a powerful political, economic, religious, or social establishment is very dangerous and very few people do it, except, perhaps, as part of a mob. To rebel against the "scientific" establishment, however, is the easiest thing in the world, and anyone can do it and feel enormously brave, without risking as much as a hangnail. Thus, the vast majority, who believe in astrology and think that the planets have nothing better to do than form a code that will tell them whether tomorrow is a good day to close a business deal or not, become all the more excited and enthusiastic about the bilge when a group of astronomers denounces it.	Isaac Asimov
...if I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.	Isaac Asimov

You will find men like him in all of the world's religions. They know that we represent reason and science, and, however confident they may be in their beliefs, they fear that we will overthrow their gods. Not necessarily through any deliberate act, but in a subtler fashion. Science can destroy a religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets.

Albert Ellis

The whole Bible was written by slave owners, and for slave owners. There is no hint of criticism of slavery anywhere in that book. Jesus made no objection to mistreatment of slaves.

Merrill Holste, "Slavery and the Bible", article in the May 1986 issue of American Atheist Magazine]

Suppose, however, that God did give this law to the Jews, and did tell them that whenever a man preached a heresy, or proposed to worship any other God that they should kill him; and suppose that afterward this same God took upon himself flesh, and came to this very chosen people and taught a different religion, and that thereupon the Jews crucified him; I ask you, did he not reap exactly what he had sown? What right would this god have to complain of a crucifixion suffered in accordance with his own command?	Ingersoll
For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant religious mass on the other. This is the war between Science and Faith. The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the known, and to happiness here in this world. The many have appealed to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and to misery hereafter. The few have said, 'Think!' The many have said, 'Believe!'	Robert G. Ingersoll, "The Gods", 1872
If the book [the Bible] and my brain are both the work of the same Infinite God, whose fault is it that the book and my brain do not agree? Robert G. Ingersoll
It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions.

On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and success.	Robert G. Ingersoll

everybody knows God exists..you just said 'God damn it!' You couldn't do that if there wasn't a god
Even if you think (as the Netscape 6.0 engineers clearly do) that Alt+Left is not a good shortcut key for "Back", there are literally millions of people out there who will try to use Alt+Left to go back, and if you refuse to do it on some general religious principle that Bill Gates is the evil smurf arch-nemesis Gargamel, then you are just gratuitously ruining your program so that you can feel smug and self-satisfied, and your users will not thank you for it.	Joel Spolsky
When you design user interfaces, it's a good idea to keep two principles in mind: 1. Users don't have the manual, and if they did, they wouldn't read it. 2. In fact, users can't read anything, and if they could, they wouldn't want to. 	Joel Spolsky
Even as the prosecution's case against Joseph Amrine fell apart over the years, the state continued to seek his execution. Indeed, at a hearing on 4 February 2003 before the Missouri Supreme Court, a prosecutor from the state Attorney General's Office argued that the Court should block Joseph Amrine from having his case reopened. One of the Justices asked whether in the absence of the Court finding a constitutional violation, the state was suggesting that "even if we find Mr Amrine is actually innocent, he should be executed?" The assistant attorney general replied, "That's correct, your honour".

Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families...and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased...And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp...And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.	Numbers 11:10-34
And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.	Numbers 21:34-35
And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?...Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.	Numbers 31:15
There are only two industries that refer to their customers as "users".	Edward Tufte
Benchmarks are like assholes. Everyone's got one and they all stink.
One of our greatest glories is closure of offending newspapers. Based on our assessments, by doing this, we have done the greatest service to the people. ... When you do a job for the sake of God, defeat is meaningless.	Abbas-Ali Alizadeh,  Head Of The Judiciary Administration In Teheran - commenting on the closure of over 50 newspapers in the last 20 months, 12 December 2001
There is no such thing as the UN. There is an international community that can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that is the US, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along.	John Bolton, US State Department
All the ills from which America suffers can be traced back to the teaching of evolution. It would be better to destroy every other book ever written, and save just the first three verses of Genesis.	William Jennings Bryan
Rail as they will about 'discrimination,' women are simply not endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition and the will to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of Western capitalism.	Pat Buchanan
In terms of the CO2 issue, I will explain as clearly as I can, today and every other chance I get, that we will not do anything that harms our economy. Because, first things first, are the people who live in America. That's my priority.	George Monkey Bush
At the end of the Mesozoic, you begin to see evidence of a stunning moral decline. Bones of wives and children all alone, with the philandering husband's bones nowhere in sight. Heaps of fossilised species living together in unnatural defiance of biblical law. Researchers have even excavated entire orgies - hundreds of animals with their bones intertwined in lewd positions. Immorality was rampant.	Rev Jesse Colson
I shall be telling the court that the Lord told me I didn't need insurance, and that that assurance is my divine protection. I have been licensed from heaven, and I will be giving the word of the Lord in court. 	Peter David, after having been stopped by police in South Wales who found he was driving with no insurance, MOT, or road tax, and had an unlicensed number plate of DEUT 818
There's a lot of it that's truth, the way I see it. Who came to this country first - the white man, didn't he? That's who made this country great.	Don Davis, Republican senator from North Carolina, commenting on an email he forwarded to every member of the state House and Senate ("Two things made this country great: White men & Christianity. Every problem that has arrisen [sic] can be directly traced back to our departure from God's Law and the disenfranchisement of White men."), 22 August 2001
Damn it, when you get married, you kind of expect you're going to get a little sex. 	Senator Jeremiah Denton Alabama - R, explaining his opposition to legislation to protect victims of rape within marriage, 1981
If you're not a born-again Christian, you're a failure as a human being. 	Rev. Jerry Falwell
It is absolutely infallible, without error in all matters pertaining to faith and practice, as well as in areas such as geography, science, history, etc.	Jerry Falwell, speaking about the bible...
A secularist represents a danger to society and the nation that must be eliminated. It is the duty of the Government to kill him.	Sheik Mohammed al-Ghozali, 1993
... a noble practice which does honour to women. 	Sheik Gad Al Haq Ali Gad Al Haq, explaining the removal of part or all of a girl's clitoris
Nothing could be more anti-Biblical than letting women vote. 	Harper's editorial
Capital punishment is our society's recognition of the sanctity of human life.	Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican Utah
I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so.	Adolph Hitler
I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator. By warding off the Jews I am fighting for the Lord's work.	Adolf Hitler
The first proposition, that the sun is the center and does not revolve around the earth, is foolish, absurd, false in theology, and heretical, because expressly contrary to Holy Scripture. The second proposition, that the earth is not the center but revolves around the sun, is absurd, false in philosophy, and from a theological point of view at least, opposed to the true faith. 	The Inquisition's Judgement on Galileo
See, God has got plans for His kids. He is going to fix it back like it used to be; you are going to be able to have your own pet dinosaur for 1000 years, fixed back like it used to be.	Kent Hovind
They know that evolution is the only philosophy that can be used to justify their political agenda of: i. Communism. ii. Racism. iii. Abortion. iv. Nazism. v. Socialism. vi. Gay rights. vii. Women's liberation. viii. Extreme environmentalism. ix. Euthanasia. x. Pornography. xi. Humanism. xii. New Age Movement.	Kent Hovind
It doesn't give me displeasure to hear of a virgin being raped. The lot of women is to be fornicated. 	Lafayette Ron Hubbard
Vaccination is a direct violation of the everlasting covenant that God made with Noah after the flood ... Vaccination never saved human life. It does not prevent smallpox.	Jehovah's Witnesses
I would shoot the bastards if I was allowed, because a woman can't represent Christ. Men and women are totally different, that's not my fault, and Jesus chose men for his disciples. ... Priestesses should be burnt at the stake because they are assuming powers they have no right to. In the medieval world that was called sorcery. The way of dealing with sorcerers was to burn them at the stake. It's illegal now but if I had my way that is what would happen to them. In medieval times, I would burn the bloody bitches. 	Rev Anthony Kennedy, on female priests.
It should be made clear that in order to live a Christian life, any Christian must be able to discriminate and hate, because that's what the bible says.	Bernhard Kuiper, Colorado Springs Pastor
The woman who is truly Spirit-filled will want to be totally submissive to her husband ... This is a truly liberated woman. Submission is God's design for women.	Beverly LaHaye
We really have dinosaurs today, without any question. You just need the right weather conditions, as I see it, to get huge creatures. And in the ocean, of course, we have huge creatures ... This is where the pleisosauruses seem to be today, and perhaps also this fire-breathing dragon is still down there - very rare, but occasionally there.	Rev. Walter Lang, Founder Of The Bible-Science Association
... the feasibility of maintaining an ark full of representative creatures for a year until the waters had sufficiently receded has been well documented.	Steven Layfield, head of (creationist) science at Emmanuel College, Gateshead
Whoever wants to be a Christian should tear the eyes out of his Reason.	Martin Luther
The word and works of God is quite clear, that women were made either to be wives or prostitutes.	Martin Luther
This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth. 	Martin Luther, speaking of Copernicus
There is on earth among all dangers no more dangerous thing than a richly endowed and adroit reason... Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed.	Martin Luther
Even though they grow weary and wear themselves out with child-bearing, it does not matter; let them go on bearing children till they die, that is what they are there for.	Martin Luther
Faith must trample under foot all reason, sense, and understanding, and whatever it sees it must put out of sight, and wish to know nothing but the word of god.	Martin Luther
Idiots, the lame, the blind, the dumb, are men in whom the devils have established themselves: and all the physicians who heal these infirmities, as though they proceeded from natural causes, are ignorant blockheads ...	Martin Luther
Men have broad and large chests, and small narrow hips, and more understanding than women, who have but small and narrow breasts, and broad hips, to the end they should remain at home, sit still, keep house, and bear and bring up children.	Martin Luther
The shedding of this man's [Salman Rushdie's] blood is obligatory. Any Muslim who hears an insult to the prophet must kill the person who commits the insult. It is better that those closest to that person try to kill him first. 	Morteza Moqtadie , Iranian Chief Prosecutor, 1998
The long-term goal of Christians in politics should be to gain exclusive control over the franchise. Those who refuse to submit publicly to the eternal sanctions of God by submitting to His Church's public marks of the covenant - baptism and holy communion - must be denied citizenship, just as they were in ancient Israel.	Gary North
If there be men on the other side of the earth, Christ must have gone there and suffered a second time to save them; and therefore there must have been, as necessary preliminaries to his coming, a duplicate Adam, Eden, serpent, and Deluge!	Father Procopius
Mars is somewhat the same distance from the Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. If oxygen, that means we can breathe.	Dan Quayle, 1989
Incest is a voluntary act on the woman's part.	From a pamphlet published by the American Life League
My personal feeling is that oral sex is against nature.	Pat Robertson
I know one man who was impotent who gave AIDS to his wife and the only thing they did was kiss.	Pat Robertson
The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.	Pat Robertson
As you know, atheists and other non believers claim women are equal to men. However, when we turn to the Bible, we find that the Creator of all mankind says females are the weaker gender. Heathen reasoning erroneously concludes that the principle of inequality of women is injustice to women. However it is not injustice, but great wisdom.	Society For The Practical Establishment And Perpetuation Of The Ten Commandments
The best way to understand the nature of atheism is to understand its author. satan is its author. ... Thus atheism is properly defined as a denial of the existence of God in the midst of full knowledge that God does indeed exist. ... Atheism is the ultimate of satanism. ... Atheism is therefore a doctrine of demons, and in many, if not all cases, atheists are demon-possessed. So it is quite possible that when you heard atheists speaking, all you heard was demons ranting against God.	Society For The Practical Establishment And Perpetuation Of The Ten Commandments
... there is no life on other planets. If there were, the Bible would have mentioned it.	Jim Staal
We ought to tell every other Muslim living in this nation that if you say one word, you're gone. 	Jimmy Swaggart
I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.	Mother Teresa
I should not allow any child entrusted to my care to be adopted by a woman who has had an abortion or used contraception. Such a woman is incapable of love.	Mother Teresa
Woman is a temple built over a sewer, the gateway to the devil. Women are the gate to hell.	Tertullian
After Jesus Christ we have no need of speculation, after the Gospel no need of research. When we come to believe, we have no desire to believe anything else; for we begin by believing that there is nothing else which we have to believe.	Tertullian
The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians.	Harry Truman
We don't have to protect the environment, the Second Coming is at hand.	James Watt, US Secretary of the Interior
Wife: Be content to be insigifigant. What loss would it be to God or man had you never been born? 	John Wesley
But if you can't rape your wife, who can you rape? 	Senator Bob Wilson California - D
Anyone who is not a true Christian, is by default, Satanic.	Steve Winter
As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation. But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?	John Adams, 1816
Do not suppose the statements of the prophets to be true. Men lived comfortably till they came and spoiled life. The "sacred books" are only such a set of idle tales as any age could have and indeed did actually produce.	Al Ma'Arri, Syrian poet
Because we must. Because we have the call. Because it is nobler to fight for rationality without winning than to give up in the face of continued defeats. Because whatever true progress humanity makes is through the rationality of the occasional individual and because any one individual we may win for the cause may do more for humanity than a hundred thousand who hug superstition to their breasts. 	Isaac Asimov on why he opposed religion
Truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.	Francis Bacon
I mean if you can believe in the Christian religion you can believe in anything, you know it's so utterly preposterous. 	Tom Baker, who was raised a catholic and lived in a monastery for 7 years.
If the answers to prayer are merely what God wills all along, then why pray?	Dan Barker
You keep accusing me of blasphemy all of the time, But I cannot be convicted of a victimless crime.	Dan Barker
Faith is a cop-out. It is intellectual bankruptcy. If the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith, then you are conceding that it can't be taken on its own merits	Dan Barker
Freethinkers reject faith as a valid tool of knowledge. Faith is the opposite of reason because reason imposes very strict limits on what can be true, and faith has no limits at all. A Great Escape into faith is no retreat to safety. It is nothing less than surrender. 	Dan Barker
To think that the ruler of the universe will run to my assistance and bend the laws of nature for me is the height of arrogance. That implies that everyone else (such as the opposing football team, driver, student, parent) is de-selected, unfavored by God, and that I am special, above it all. 	Dan Barker
In matters of religion it is very easy to deceive a man, and very hard to undeceive him. 	Pierre Bayle, 1697
It is proof of a base and low mind for one to wish to think with the masses or majority, merely because the majority is the majority. Truth does not change because it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people. 	Giordano Bruno, 1548
The idea that a good God would send people to a burning hell is utterly damnable to me. The ravings of insanity! Superstition gone to seed! I don't want to have anything to do with such a God.	Luther Burbank
Atheism is no more a religion than abstinence is a form of drinking.	Marilyn Burge
By simple common sense I don't believe in God, in none.	Charlie Chaplin
For every credibility gap, there is a gullibility fill.	Richard Clopton
I dream that someday the United States will be on the side of the peasants in some civil war. I dream that we will be the ones who will help the poor overthrow the rich, who will talk about land reform and education and health facilities for everyone, and that when the Red Cross or Amnesty International comes to count the bodies and take the testimony of women raped, that our side won't be the heavies.	Richard Cohen
The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.	Joseph Conrad
The United States is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today	Martin Luther King
Terrorists hate America because America is a land of freedom and opportunity. We intend to attack the root causes of terrorism.
Its the foolish cat that looks at the finger when it is pointing at the food
Jonathan Goode (grade 7) applied findings from many fields of science to support his conclusion that God designed women for homemaking: physics shows that women have a lower center of gravity than men, making them more suited to carrying groceries and laundry baskets; biology shows that women were designed to carry un-born babies in their wombs and to feed born babies milk, making them the natural choice for child rearing; social sciences show that the wages for women workers are lower than for normal workers, meaning that they are unable to work as well and thus earn equal pay; and exegetics shows that God created Eve as a companion for Adam, not as a co-worker. 7th grader science project
At this point I'd have to say the primary strength of C++ is performance. That's the only compelling reason to use it at this point, because the downsides are many -- the excessive complexity of the language and lack of garbage collection are the two biggest time-wasters. I still enjoy C++ as an intellectual puzzle; I keep learning from it. But I would be very reluctant to use it exclusively for a significant project, unless there was a constraint that required it.	Bruce Eckel, author of "Thinking In C++"
I was incredibly skeptical about C# at first, for quite awhile. However, as time passed and I began to learn about the language, I started to see that it really is a better Java. 	Bruce Eckel, author of "Thinking in Java"
C# is the best thing Microsoft has done in the language arena, very well thought-out and architected.	Bruce Eckel, author of various C++, Java and Python books.
Do you know why they call it "PMS"? Because "Mad Cow Disease" was taken.
Religion is a defense against the experience of God	Carl Jung
I think they should have added a giant blue elephant to Christianity, it would've been cool for Jesus to ride that around.	s0meb0die
A. Because it breaks the logical order of conversation. Q. Why is top posting bad?
It is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders. That is easy. All you have to tell them is that they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.	Hermann Göring
I was reading about what was going on in Afghanistan--the way women were being oppressed, the destruction of religious statues. And when I heard that song [Raining Blood], I just imagined a huge juicy vagina coming out of the sky, raining blood over all those racist, misogynist fuckers.	Tori Amos
I've had a lot of response from the fundamentalist Christians over here. God, I'm going to hell! In the southern states of America they won't play me at all. God was the No. 1 record on US alternative radio for four weeks and they wouldn't play it. It's really funny. I'm the Devil's Daughter down there and I have to chuckle because these guys are missing the point. This is about freedom. 	Tori Amos
Get off the cross, we need the wood.	Tori Amos
I find that being a minister's daughter was a great gift because I saw the dark side of Christianity.	Tori Amos
Where I come from, a cockroach is a roach, and a cockerel is a rooster because they can't bring themselves to say cock.	Tori Amos
I refuse to simply accept God's will. I receive a lot of letters from women who write that they've been raped by their father for years, from the time they were little children. Then don't start insulting those women, especially not while I'm around, by saying that it's God's will. And I don't need to hear that it's karma either.	Tori Amos
The animus in me is raspberry swirl, I'm in love with my women friends, but I just don't eat pussy. But I'm in love with them. If I had a different sensibility, then you know I think I could, you know, really fulfill someone down there, where a lot of men in their lives don't. And eating pussy is a metaphor, too - it's about crawling in there, being with their juices, really being with them.	Tori Amos
I don't want to be buried. My Grandmother was convinced I should be burned as a witch and I think that's probably right, that's how I should go. I think fire is cleansing and beautiful. So I definitely want to be cremated and not put in a confined space.	Tori Amos
He's [Tori's father] taken a lot over the years. One song that upset him the most was Father Lucifer. He was very hurt about that. I said, `Dad, this is not about you. I took drugs, took a journey, a shamanic experience, and I had an affair with Lucifer'. I said this at the Sunday dinner table with the chicken. Everyone put their forks down and went, `Oh no'. but my Dad just went, `Oh. OK then'.	Tori Amos
The truth is that anybody who exercises power, whether it is a partner, a government or a religion, only wishes that the others remain fools.	Tori Amos
That's the greatest compliment I've received [Eminem fans hate her cover of '97 Bonnie & Clyde].	Tori Amos
I'm known as that girl who has tea with the devil. I'm the thing that fundamentalist Christians cringe over. Mothers drag their daughters out of my shows. Because their daughters are going, 'hey, maybe I don't have to think about these things. Why am I worshipping some dead guy?’	Tori Amos
On some of my darkest days, Lucifer's the one who comes and gives me an ice cream.	Tori Amos
I get everyone except the paedophiles. I think Britney Spears gets all those.	Tori Amos
... I used to get really pissed off that my life was so dictated by when this Jesus guy was born and when he was dying every year. I felt really resentful that I couldn't get on with my own life, because I was so busy with his. Of course the real energy of Jesus had nothing to do with it... There would be prayer meetings at our house, and I'd think, `How do I escape this?' My song Icicle has a lot to do with it. It's about how this girl masturbates just to survive!	Tori Amos
Right. Then no man wants to fuck her anymore and also the urge of women to be just like her will dry up. Then Britney won't be of any use anymore, because she can't sing and she doesn't have anything to say either. And that's sad. Mainly for her, though, because it must be frickin' scary to be so dependent on your looks. I sincerely hope in music a new generation of women will stand up that have something to say. It's about time.	Tori Amos on Britney Spears
Sometimes after the show children tell me they're in an incestuous situation. When they say it's God's will, I can cut the culprit's throat. Abuse isn't what God was talking about. Absolutely not. Fuck 'God's will'.	Tori Amos
I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared. So God cured me of the headache.
Why should I allow that same God to tell me how to raise my kids, who had to drown His own?	Robert Ingersoll
There is no harmony between religion and science. When science was a child, religion sought to strangle it in the cradle. Now that science has attained its youth, and superstition is in its dotage, the trembling, palsied wreck says to the athlete: 'Let us be friends.' It reminds me of the bargain the cock wished to make with the horse: 'Lut us agree not to step on each other's feet.'	Robert Ingersoll
For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant religious mass on the other. This is the war between Science and Faith. The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the known, and to happiness here in this world. The many have appealed to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and to misery hereafter. The few have said, "Think!" The many have said, "Believe!	Robert Ingersoll
'In God We Trust.' I don't believe it would sound any better if it were true.	Mark Twain
Religion consists in a set of things which the average man thinks he believes and wishes he was certain of.	Mark Twain
Religion is based . . . mainly on fear . . . fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand	Bertrand Russell
A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.	Albert Einstein
We must respect the other fellow's religion, but only in the same sense and to the same extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart.	HL Mencken
Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable. . . . A man full of faith is simply one who has lost (or never had) the capacity for clear and realistic thought. He is not a mere ass: he is actually ill.	HL Mencken
God is the immemorial refuge of the incompetent, the helpless, the miserable. They find not only sanctuary in His arms, but also a kind of superiority, soothing to their macerated egos; He will set them above their betters.	HL Mencken
He comes into the world God knows how, walks on the water, gets out of his grave and goes up off the Hill of Howth. What drivel is this?	James Joyce
I confess that I do not see what good it does to fulminate against the English tyranny while the Roman tyranny occupies the palace of the soul.	James Joyce
We should be agnostic about those things for which there is no evidence. We should not hold beliefs merely because they gratify our desires for afterlife, immortality, heaven, hell, etc.	Julian Huxley
No country or people who are slaves to dogma and dogmatic mentality can progress.	Jawaharlal Nehru
By simple common sense I don't believe in God, in none.	Charlie Chaplin
You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. . . . Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat's meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.	Aldous Huxley
History does not record anywhere or at any time a religion that has any rational basis. Religion is a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up to the unknown without help. But, like dandruff, most people do have a religion and spend time and money on it and seem to derive considerable pleasure from fiddling with it.	RAH
If you want to get together in any exclusive situation and have people love you, fine -- but to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if you've been bad or good -- and CARES about any of it -- to hang it all on that, folks, is the chimpanzee part of the brain working.	Frank Zappa
With enough eyes, all bugs are shallow, except for the bugs left over after all the shallow ones have been fixed.
It may not be true that all Conservatives are stupid people, but it is certainly the case that all stupid people are Conservative.	John Stuart Mill
