My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race. I cannot, however, deny that it has made some contributions to civilization. It helped in early days to fix the calendar, and it caused Egyptian priests to chronicle eclipses with such care that in time they became able to predict them.

"I hadn't looked at it like that," he said, "But you're absolutely right. He's really pushed back the boundaries of ignorance."	Discworld scientists at work (Terry Pratchett, Equal Rites)
The computer was conceived as a tool to reduce complexity. Some people found this loss of complexity unacceptable, and developed UNIX to reintroduce it.
Curiously enough, the volume of interest and public debate is often inversely proportional to the importance of a feature. The reason is that it is much easier to have a firm opinion on a minor feature than on a major one; minor features fit directly into the current state of affairs, whereas major ones - by definition - do not.	Bjarne Stroustrup
I see the internet comes on computers these days.... 	Homer Simpson
The Devil's greatest accomplishment was the invention of religion
If you have any trouble sounding condescending, find a Unix user to show you how it's done. 	Scott Adams

Frank Zappa

If God dropped acid, would he see people?	Stephen Wright
If he [god] is wise, why did he not compose a coherent account of what he wanted mankind to do? No, the Bible is not such an account; nobody can agree in what it says. The very god who, according to those who believe in him, made every last electron spin in its orbit everywhere throughout the universe, still cannot write a clear, unmistakable volume of instructions to human beings who are supposed to follow his wishes, Instead, he allegedly gives us the Bible or Koran, or some other jumble of ridiculous and ancient superstitions...	Fred Woodworth

Do you want real TRUTH in capital letters? Then search yourself for why you believe the things you do. Don't be afraid to analyze why your religion gives you the high it does. Answer yourself this question: Is TRUTH important enough for me to give up my religion if that is required? Until you answer yes to this you are not being honest with yourself.	Dave Trissel
I believe Christ was a man like ourselves; to look upon him as God would seem to me the greatest of sacrileges	Leo Tolstoy

Let a wave of intolerance wash over you. I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you. Yes, hate is good.... If a Christian voted for Clinton, he sinned against God. It's that simple.... Our goal is a Christian Nation... we have a biblical duty, we are called by God to conquer this country. We don't want equal time. We don't want Pluralism. We want theocracy.

There is no such source and cause of strife, quarrel, fights, malignant opposition, persecution, and war, and all evil in the state, as religion.

District Board, March 18, 1890

Thank you, but I'm afraid I can't accept your compliment. You see, I'm an atheist, so if I'm also God, that would mean that I don't believe in myself, and at this point in my life, I don't need the added insecurity.	J Michael Straczynski, when told by a fan that he was God

To kill a man is not to defend a doctrine, but to kill a man.	Michael Servetus
Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains people as to how they shall think.	Arthur Schopenhauer
Consider, for example, the Koran. This wretched book was sufficient to found a religion of the world, to satisfy the metaphysical need of innumerable millions of men for twelve hundred years, to become the foundation of their morality, and of no small contempt for death, and also to inspire them to bloody wars and most extended conquests.	Schopenhauer
A healthy nature needs no God or immortality.	Johann Schiller
God is dead. Let us not understand by this that he does not exist or even that he no longer exists. He is dead. He spoke to us and is silent. We no longer have anything but his cadaver. Perhaps he slipped out of the world, somewhere else like the soul of a dead man. Perhaps he was only a dream...God is dead.	Sartre
For Shakespeare, in the matter of religion, the choice lay between Christianity and nothing. He chose nothing.
The Bible is a wonderful source of inspiration for those who don't understand it.	George Santayana
Two recent surveys rate the United States at the top among Western nations in belief in God and at the bottom among six major countries in school kids' understanding of science and math. This could be dismissed as chance, but it shouldn't be. While our economic competitors' schools are teaching students advanced math and science, many of our schools are wasting energy debating whether to teach evolution or creationism, which maintains that God created the universe over a six-day period about 6,000 years ago.	Bill Mandel
He posted no brief in defense or mitigation of his offenses, and when he was most solemnly advised by the Court President of the dire consequences he faced if found guilty, Juan Damasceno volunteered only one comment: It will mean I do not go to the Christian heaven?' He was told that that would indeed be the worst of his punishments:that he would most assuredly not go to Heaven. At which, his smile sent a thrill of horror through every soul of the Court." "Aztec" - Gary Jennings
Religion is a monumental chapter in the history of human egotism.	William James (1842-1910)

Fear believes -- courage doubts. Fear falls upon the earth and prays -- courage stands erect and thinks. Fear is barbarism -- courage is civilization. Fear believes in witchcraft, in devils and in ghosts. Fear is religion, courage is science.	Robert G Ingersoll
As long as man believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master. The civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of unbelief -- the result of free thought.	Robert G Ingersoll
The book, called the Bible, is filled with passages equally horrible, unjust and atrocious. This is the book to be read in schools in order to make our children loving, kind and gentle! This is the book they wish to be recognized in our Constitution as the source of all authority and justice!	Ingersoll
Nothing is so pleasing to these gods as the butchery of unbelievers. Nothing so enrages them, even now, as to have someone deny their existence.	Ingersoll
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so	Douglas Adams
Ford, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it.
If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.
In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were REAL men, women were REAL women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were REAL small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.
In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.	Douglas Adams
The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.

We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them.' The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford.`Stick it up your nose,' he said.`Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,' insisted the girl, `Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?'
Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much... the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely the dolphins believed themselves to be more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons.	Douglas Adams
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexeplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.	Douglas Adams
My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre, and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes.
Anything that happens, happens. Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, causes itself to happen again. It doesn't all necessarily happen chronologically, though.	Douglas Adams
God's final message to Creation: Sorry for the inconvenience.	Douglas Adams
I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls.	Albert Einstein
God does not play dice with the universe: He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players,* to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with balcnk cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.	Neil Gaiman/Terry Pratchett
Lord, protect me from your followers!
I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth	Thomas Jefferson
The knack of flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.	Douglas Adams
You barbarians! I'll sue the council for every penny it's got! I'l have you hung, drawn, and quartered! And whipped! And boiled...until...until...until you've had enough. And then I will do it again! And when I've finished I will take all the little bits, and I will JUMP on them! And I will carry on jumping on them until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do...	Arthur Dent
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.	The Guide
God made me an atheist. Who are you to question his wisdom?
I reverse the phrase of Voltaire, and say that if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.	Michael Bakunin
It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, "mad cow" disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.	Richard Dawkins
This would be the best of all possible words if there were no [organized] religion in it	John Adams
I do not see how it is possible for an intelligent human being to conclude that the Song of Solomon is the work of God, and that the tragedy of Lear was the work of an uninspired man.	Robert Ingersoll
We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.	Gene Roddenberry
My spell-checker lacks the word 'creationism' in its dictionary, so each time that word is encountered, an alternative pops up at the bottom of my screen, 'cretinism'	E.T. Babinski
Jesus' last words on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" hardly seem like the words of a man who planned it that way. It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure there is something wrong here.	Donald Morgan
But a short time elapsed after the death of the great reformer of the Jewish religion, before his principles were departed from by those who professed to be his special servants, and perverted into an engine for enslaving mankind, and aggrandizing their oppressors in Church and State.	Thomas Jefferson
...any belief in supernatural creators, rulers, or influencers of natural or human process introduces an irreparable split into the universe, and prevents us from grasping its real unity. Any belief in Absolutes, whether the absolute validity of moral commandments, of authority of revelation, of inner certitudes, or of divine inspiration, erects a formidable barrier against progress and the responsibility of improvement, moral, rational, and religious.	Julian Huxley
To assert that the earth revolves around the sun is as erroneous as to claim that Jesus was not born of a virgin.	Cardinal Bellarmine
I do think the Roman Catholic religion is a disease of the mind which has a particular epidemiology similar to that of a virus... Religion is a terrific meme. That's right. But that doesn't make it true and I care about what's true. Smallpox virus is a terrific virus. It does its job magnificently well. That doesn't mean that it's a good thing. It doesn't mean that I don't want to see it stamped out.	Richard Dawkins
Religion is fundamentally opposed to everything I hold in veneration--courage, clear thinking, honesty, fairness, and, above all, love of the truth.	Henry Louis Mencken
The sense of spiritual relief, which comes from rejecting the idea of God as a supernatural being, is enormous.	Julian Huxley
Take from the church the miraculous, the supernatural, the incomprehensible, the unreasonable, the impossible, the unknowable, the absurd, and nothing but a vacuum remains.	Robert G Ingersoll
There are none more ignorant and useless, than they that seek answers on their knees, with their eyes closed
Several thousand years ago, a small tribe of ignorant near-savages wrote various collections of myths, wild tales, lies, and gibberish. Over the centuries, these stories were embroidered, garbled, mutilated, and torn into small pieces that were then repeatedly shuffled. Finally, this material was badly translated into several languages successively. The resultant text, creationists feel, is the best guide to this complex and technical subject.
Christian Fundamentalism: The doctrine that there is an absolutely powerful, infinitely knowledgeable, universe spanning entity that is deeply and personally concerned about my sex life.
'God is as real as I am', the old man said. I was relieved since I knew Santa wouldn't lie to me...
Anyone who engages in the practice of psychotherapy confronts every day the devastation wrought by the teachings of religion.	Nathaniel Branden, Ph.D
For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone- written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command or faith a dictum. I am my own God. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.	Charles Bukowski
Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of 10 things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these 10 things he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry for ever and ever until the end of time...but he loves you.	George Carlin
When a man ceases to believe in god, he does not believe in nothing. He believes in everything.	G.K Chesterton
I've been reading an Alabama newspaper that one man shot another man because he beat him in a Bible-quoting competition.
I believe the spreading of Catholicism to be the most horrible means of political and social degradation left in the world.	Charles Dickens
Asked soon after Carl's death: "Didn't [Sagan] want to believe?" She responded, "He didn't want to believe. He wanted to  know."	Carl Sagan's wife Ann Druyan
The gods can either take away evil from the world and will not, or, being willing to do so, cannot; or they neither can nor will, or lastly, they are both able and willing. If they have the will to remove evil and cannot, then they are not omnipotent. If they can, but will not, than they are not benevolent. If they are neither able nor willing, then they are neither omnipotent nor benevolent. Lastly, if they are both able and willing to annihilate evil, how does it exist?	Epicures
If 50 million people believe a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing	Anatole France
In the long run nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction religion offers to both is only too palpable.	Sigmund Freud
Randomness scares people. Religion is a way to explain randomness.	Fran Lebowitz

The only force more devastating than a nuclear holocaust is a group of Christians fresh out of church.	Matt Polek
It is an interesting and demonstrable fact, that all children are atheists and were religion not inculcated into their minds, they would remain so.	Ernestine Rose
This above all: to thine own self be true.	Polonius(Hamlet)
It's an incredible con job when you think about it, to believe something now in exchange for something after death. Even corporations with their reward systems don't try to make it posthumous.	Gloria Steinem
Truth in matters of religion is simply the opinion that has survived.	Oscar Wilde
Fundamentalists are like the fir trees in German forests: they cannot stand alone, and are only stable when crowded together, branches locked with those of their brothers. That is why we must always fear them, because they will always hate us for our individualism.	Brent Yaciw
Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.	Thomas Jefferson
During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution.	James Madison
Our Bible reveals to us the character of our god with minute and remorseless exactness... It is perhaps the most damnatory biography that exists in print anywhere. It makes Nero an angel of light and leading by contrast	Mark Twain
O Lord our God, help us tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it...	Mark Twain
Man is a marvelous curiosity ... he thinks he is the Creator's pet ... he even believes the Creator loves him; has a passion for him; sits up nights to admire him; yes and watch over him and keep him out of trouble. He prays to him and thinks He listens. Isn't it a quaint idea.	Mark Twain
If there is a God, he is a malign thug.	Mark Twain
It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.	Albert Einstein
If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?	Albert Einstein
During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution, human fantasy created gods in man's own image who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate influence, the phenomenal world... The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old conception of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes... In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vase power in the hands of priests.	Albert Einstein
All thinking men are atheists	Ernest Hemingway
I condemn false prophets, I condemn the effort to take away the power of rational decision, to drain people of their free will--and a hell of a lot of money in the bargain. Religions vary in their degree of idiocy, but I reject them all. For most people, religion is nothing more than a substitute for a malfunctioning brain.	Gene Roddenberry
It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God, but to create him.	Arthur C Clarke
I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do because I notice it always coincides with their own desires.	Susan B Anthony
Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.	Benjamin Franklin
No man who ever lived knows any more about the hereafter ... than you and I; and all religion ... is simply evolved out of chicanery, fear, greed, imagination and poetry.	Edgar Allan Poe
Of all religions the Christian is without doubt the one which should inspire tolerance most, although up to now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.	Voltaire
Christianity is the most ridiculous, the most absurd and bloody religion that has ever infected the world.	Voltaire
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?	Epicurus
Christ was only crucified once, and for a few hours. Think of the thousands he has been crucifying in a quiet way ever since	Samuel Butler
Men will never be free until the last king is strangled in the entrails of the last priest.	Denis Diderot
The Christian religion teaches us to imitate a God that is cruel, insidious, jealous, and implacable in his wrath.	Denis Diderot
Religion is too important a matter to its devotees to be a subject of ridicule. If they indulge in absurdities, they are to be pitied rather than ridiculed.	Immanuel Kant
No kingdom has ever suffered as many civil wars as the kingdom of Christ.	Baron de Montesquieu
Atheism is the vice of a few intelligent people.	Voltaire
Every sensible man, every honest man, must hold the Christian sect in horror. But what shall we substitute in it's place? you say. What? A ferocious animal has sucked the blood of my relatives. I tell you to rid yourselves of this beast, and you ask me what you shall put in it's place?	Voltaire
If a man would follow, today, the teachings of the Old Testament, he would be a criminal. If he would follow strictly the teachings of the New, he would be insane.	Robert G Ingersoll
The hands that help are better far than the lips that pray.	Robert G Ingersoll
In this “sacred” book of family scandals we find filth, sex orgies, cannibalism, atrocities, sex perversions, incest, bloody violence unparalleled in any other chronicle in all the literature of the world. Fortunately, not one- third of the human family has ever heard of the Christian Bible; not one-tenth of the Christians have ever read it, and no two who have read it agree as to its meaning. Won’t you help get this book out of the hands of our children, out of decent homes, and out of hotel and motel rooms? 	Frank C Hughes
If God lived on earth, people would break his windows.	Jewish proverb
Christian: I'll pray for you. Atheist: Then I'll think for both of us.
I think therefore I'm dangerous
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.	Thomas Paine
The god of the Bible measures up to the level of a petty and vicious tyrant. The god of the bible punishes babies for the sins of their parents (Exodus 20:5, 34:7; Numbers 14:18; 2 Samuel 12:13-19); punishes people by causing them to become cannibals and eat their children (2 Kings 6:24-33, Lamentations 4:10-11); gives people bad laws, even requiring the sacrifice of their firstborn babies, so that they can be filled with horror and know that god is their lord (Ezekiel 20:25-26); causes people to believe lies so that he can send them to hell (2 Thessalonians 2:11), and many other atrocities, far too many to list here. It would not be hard to measure up to, and exceed, that level of moral purity. Atheists surpass it every day.	Doug Krueger
If you think your belief is based upon reason, you will support it by argument rather than by persecution, and will abandon it if the argument goes against you. But if your belief is based upon faith, you will realize that argument is useless, and will therefore resort to force either in the form of persecution or by stunting or distorting the minds of the young in what is called 'education.'	Bertrand Russell
I do not pretend to know what many ignorant men are sure -- that is all agnosticism means.	Clarence Darrow
Cabalistic Christianity, which is Catholic Christianity, and which has prevailed for 1,500 years, has received a mortal wound, of which the monster must finally die. Yet so strong is his constitution, that he may endure for centuries before he expires.	John Adams
Forgive, O Lord, any little jokes on Thee, and I'll forgive Thy great big one on me.	Robert Frost
Naturally, since [the Sumerians] didn't know what caused the flood anymore than we do, they blamed the gods.  (That's the advantage of religion. You're never short an explanation for anything.)	Isaac Asimov
No actual tyrant known to history has ever been guilty of one-hundredth of the crimes, massacres, and other atrocities attributed to the Deity in the Bible.	Steve Allen
The essence of Christianity is told us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is, All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and hadn't asked any questions.	Frank Zappa
The Lord slew Onan, and to this day the Christian world cannot understand why he stopped with Onan, instead of slaying all the inhabitants for three hundred miles around -- they being innocent of offense, and therefore the very ones he would usually slay. For that had always been his idea of fair dealing. If he had had a motto, it would have read, 'Let no innocent person escape.'	Mark Twain
It is impossible that there should be inhabitants on the opposite side of the Earth, since no such race is recorded by Scripture among the descendants of Adam.	St. Augustine
Women should not be enlightened or educated in any way. They should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of hideous and involuntary erections in holy men.	St. Augustine
The good Christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who make empty prophecies. The danger already exists that mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine man in the bonds of Hell.	St. Augustine
We all know that those who instigate those doubts are the enemies of God, the enemies of religion and the enemies of all humanity. Their hearts are full of hatred.	The comment of the Justice Minister of Saudi Arabia to the Amnesty reports on the country's human rights record
The Christian glories in the death of a pagan, because thereby Christ himself is glorified.	St Bernard of Clairvaux
If we have to give up either religion or education, we should give up education.	William Jennings Bryan
I will never apologize for the United States of America - I don't care what the facts are.	George Bush, commenting on the killing of 290 passengers shot down by the USS Vincennes
Every woman should be filled with shame by the thought that she is a woman.	St. Clement of Alexandria
The truth is that nowhere on the face of the earth, in all of time, were servants better treated or better loved than they were in the Old South by white, black, Hispanic and Indian slave owners.	Senator Charles Davidson, Alabama R
The less we think or know about hygiene, the less we are predisposed to sickness	Mary Baker Eddy
The AIDs virus also discriminates on religious or political views. Those people who are liberals, or atheist, or agnostic, or buy into "new age" anything goes, are at high risk of getting AIDs and dying.	Bob Enyart
The little child is in this red hot oven. Hear how it screams to come out. See how it turns and twists itself about in the fire. It beats its head against the roof of the oven. It stamps its little feet on the floor of the oven. You can see on the face of this little child what you see on the faces of all in hell - despair, desperate and horrible! The same law which is for others is also for children. If children, knowingly and willingly, break God's commandments, they must also be punished like others. This child committed very bad mortal sins, knowing well the harm of what it was doing, and knowing that hell would be the punishment. God was very good to this child. Very likely God saw that this child would get worse and worse, and would never repent, and so it would have to be punished much more in hell. So God, in His mercy, called it out of the world in its early childhood.	Father John Furniss
We should always be disposed to believe that that which appears white is really black, if the hierarchy of the Church so decides.	Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits
A woman should endure any violence or torture imposed on her by her husband for she is fully at his disposal. Without his permission she may not leave her house even for a good action (such as charitable work). Otherwise her prayers and devotions will not be accepted by God and curses of heaven and earth will fall upon her.	Hojatoleslam Imani
Killing is a form of mercy because it rectifies the person. Sometimes a person cannot be reformed unless he is cut up and burnt. ... You must kill, burn and lock up those in opposition.	Ayatollah Khomeini
Read the Bible. It teaches you how to act. Read the hymn book. It contains the finest poetry ever written. Read the almanac. It shows you how to figure out what the weather will be. There isn't another book that is necessary for anyone to read, and therefore I am opposed to all libraries.	Hal Kimberly, Georgia legislator
It should be made clear that in order to live a Christian life, any Christian must be able to discriminate and hate, because that's what the bible says.	Bernhard Piper, Colorado Springs pastor
Reason should be destroyed in all Christians.	Martin Luther
The word and works of God is quite clear, that women were made either to be wives or prostitutes.	Martin Luther
Make short work with heretics, they can be condemned unheard. And while they are burning at the stake, the faithful should destroy the evil root and branch and bathe his hands in the blood of the bishops and the pope who is the devil in disguise.	Martin Luther
To embrace a woman is to embrace a sack of manure...	St. Odo of Cluny
It was once proposed that all religions persuasions should be free and their worship publicly exercised. We Catholics have rejected this article as contrary to Roman Catholic canon law	Pope Pius VII
It is a just retribution for improper sexual conduct. [on AIDS] 	Mother Teresa
By fearing whom I trust I find my way to truth; by trusting wholly I betray the trust of wisdom; better far is doubt which brings the false into the light of day.	Al-Ma'arri, Syrian poet
Hanifs [Muslims] are stumbling, Christians all astray Jews wildered, Magians far on error's way. We mortals are composed of two great schools: Enlightened knaves or else religious fools.	Al-Ma'arri, Syrian Poet
Shrines! Shrines! Surely you don't believe in the gods. What's your argument? Where's your proof?	Aristophanes
Men create gods after their own image, not only with regard to their form but with regard to their mode of life.	Aristotle
I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse.	Isaac Asimov
The fundamentalists deny that evolution has taken place; they deny that the earth and the universe as a whole are more than a few thousand years old, and so on. There is ample scientific evidence that the fundamentalists are wrong in these matters, and that their notions of cosmogony have about as much basis in fact as the Tooth Fairy has.	Isaac Asimov
It is precisely because it is fashionable for Americans to know no science, even though they may be well educated otherwise, that they so easily fall prey to nonsense. They thus become part of the armies of the night, the purveyors of nitwittery, the retailers of intellectual junk food, the feeders on mental cardboard, for their ignorance keeps them from distinguishing nectar from sewage. 	Isaac Asimov
Imagine the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore, totally, all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written. And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes.	Isaac Asimov
The opinion of 10,000 men is of no value if none of them know anything about the subject.	Marcus Aurelius
What happens when the same number of people pray for something as pray against it? How does God decide whose prayer to answer? Does the total number of people praying for or against something matter? How about the righteousness of the supplicants? Are positive prayers answered more frequently than negative ones? Does God take the positive ones and Satan the negative? Does the intensity of the praying have any effect on the outcome? Does the length of time one devotes to praying have any effect on the frequency with which one's prayers are answered? Do the words and phrases used in the prayer - either positive or negative - have any bearing on the success rate? Does the nature of the thing or things prayed for have any bearing on the prayer's success rate - either positive or negative prayers? Why or why not?	Robert A Baker
Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have.	James Baldwin
You can cite a hundred references to show that the biblical God is a bloodthirsty tyrant, but if they can dig up two or three verses that say "God is love" they will claim that you are taking things out of context!	Dan Barker
Truth does not demand belief. Scientists do not join hands every Sunday, singing, "yes, gravity is real! I will have faith! I will be strong! I believe in my heart thatwhat goes up, up, up must come down, down. down. Amen!" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about it.	Dan Baker
I do not know that Christianity holds anything more of importance for the world. It is finished, played out. The only trouble lies in how to get rid of the body before it begins to smell too much. 	John Beevers
Heathen. A benighted creature who has the folly to worship something he can see and feel. 	Ambrose Bierce
Pray. To ask the laws of the universe to be annulled on behalf of a single petitioner confessedly unworthy.	Ambrose Bierce
Faith. Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel.	Ambrose Bierce
The Christian Right always needs scapegoats, and the rise of AIDS since the mid-eighties has made a convenient scapegoat of anyone whose sexuality encompasses more than breeding in the missionary position.	Poppy Z Brite
Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do not believe in anything because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with  reason, and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, accept it and live up to it.	Buddha
The more I read about man and his maniacal ruthlessness and his murderous envious scatological soul, the more I realize that he will never change. Our stupidity is immortal, nothing will change it. The same mistakes, the same prejudices, the same injustice, the same lusts wheel endlessly around the parade ground of the centuries. Immutable and ineluctable. I wish I could believe in a god of some kind but I simply cannot	Richard Burton
Belief like any other moving body follows the path of least resistance.	Samuel Butler
Prayers are to men as dolls are to children. They are not without use and comfort, but it is not easy to take them seriously.	Samuel Butler
I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's there for me every day, and the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don’t have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to 'God' are all answered at about the same 50% rate.	George Carlin
Ok, you win. You proved that your god it the best there ever was at hide'n'seek. Now, trot him out here so that we can give him his reward.	Dan Ceppa
We were brought up to fear, to fear, to fear. To fear the nuns, to fear God, to fear the Devil. We were never taught to love or given any love. I suffered physical abuse, mental abuse, psychological abuse and spiritual abuse.	Maggie Chapman, survivor of church orphanage
I would defend the liberty of concenting adult creationists to practice whatever intellectual perversions they like in the privacy of their own homes; but it is also necessary to protect the young and innocent.	Arthur C Clarke
Religion is a by-product of fear. For much of human history, it may have been a necessary evil, but why was it more evil than necessary? Isn't killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity?	Arthur C Clarke
The religionists apologize that although the Bible was inspired by God, it was, unfortunately, written by ancient, ignorant, half-civilized people.	C.W.Dalton
Just think of the tragedy of teaching children not to doubt.	Clarence Darrow
I am an Agnostic because I am not afraid to think. I am not afraid of any god in the universe who would send me or any other man or woman to hell. If there were such a being, he would not be a god; he would be a devil.	Clarence Darrow
Do you, good people, believe that Adam and Eve were created in the Garden of Eden and that they were forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge? I do. The church has always been afraid of that tree. It still is afraid of knowledge. Some of you say religion makes people happy. So does laughing gas. So does whiskey. I believe in the brain of man. I'm not worried about my soul.	Clarence Darrow
I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world.	Richard Dawkins
Faith is powerful enough to immunize people against all appeals to pity, to forgiveness, to decent human feelings. It even immunizes them against fear, if they honestly believe that a martyr's death will send them straight to heaven. What a weapon! Religious faith deserves a chapter to itself in the annals of war technology, on an even footing with the longbow, the warhorse, the tank, and the hydrogen bomb. 	Richard Dawkins
Blind faith can justify anything. In a man believes in a different god, or even if he uses a different ritual for worshipping the same god, blind faith can decree that he should die - on the cross, at the stake, skewered on a Crusader's sword, shot in a Beirut street, or blown up in a bar in Belfast. Memes for blind faith have their own ruthless ways of propagating themselves. This is true of patriotic and political as well as religious blind faith	Richard Dawkins
The Judaical and Christian theology show us a partial god who chooses or rejects, who loves or hates, according to his caprice; in short, a tyrant who plays with his creatures; who punishes in this world the whole human species for the crimes of a single man; who predestines the greater number of mortals to be his enemies, to the end that he may punish them to all eternity, for having received from him the liberty of declaring against him.	Denis Diderot
An Inuit hunter asked the local missionary priest: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?" "No," said the priest, "not if you did not know." "Then why," asked the Inuit earnestly, "did you tell me?"	Annie Dillard
When I look upon seamen, men of physical science, and philosophers, man is the wisest of all beings. When I look upon priests, prophets, and interpreters of dreams, nothing is so contemptible as man.	Diogenes
I continue to be bemused by women fighting for the right to be xtian priests. The whole religion and its textbooks are so sexist that it seems as mad as a jew fighting for the right to join a nazi party.	John Drayton, alt.atheism
He who will not reason, is a bigot; He who cannot, is a fool; And he who dares not, is a slave.	William Drummond
The idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I am unable to take seriously. 	Albert Einstein
I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance - but for us, not for God.	Albert Einstein
Parsons always seem to be specially horrified about things like sunbathing and naked bodies. They don't mind poverty and misery and cruelty to animals nearly as much.	Susan Ertz
Religion stills a thinking mind.	Greg Erwin
Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, "Some gardener must tend this plot." The other disagrees, "There is no gardener." So, they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener... So they set up a barbed wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol it with bloodhounds... But no shrieks even suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. "But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves." At last the Skeptic despairs, "But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even no gardener at all?"
I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely above it.	Benjamin Franklin
Once a doctrine, however irrational, has gained power in a society, millions of people will believe it rather than feel ostracized and isolated.	Erich Fromm
Man is forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He acts against God's command... From the standpoint of the Church, which represents authority, this is essentially sin. From the standpoint of man, however, this is the beginning of human freedom.	Erich Fromm
I think that in the discussion of natural problems we ought to begin not with the Scriptures, but with experiments, and demonstrations. 	Galileo Galilei
The most heinous and the most cruel crimes of which history has record have been committed under the cover of religion or equally noble motives.	Gandhi
Christianity, above all, consoles; but there are naturally happy souls who do not need consolation. Consequently, Christianity begins by making such souls unhappy, for otherwise it would have no power over them.	André Gide
Christianity is most admirably adapted to the training of slaves, to the perpetuation of a slave society.	Emma Goldman
Christ and his teachings are the embodiment of submission, of inertia, of the denial of life; hence responsible for the things done in their name.	Emma Goldman
We Americans claim to be a peace-loving people. We hate bloodshed; we are opposed to violence. Yet we go into spasms of joy over the possibility of projecting dynamite bombs from flying machines upon helpless citizens. We are ready to hang, electrocute, or lynch anyone, who, from economic necessity, will risk his own life in the attempt upon that of some industrial magnate. Yet our hearts swell with pride at the thought that America is becoming the most powerful nation on earth, and that it will eventually plant her iron foot on the necks of all other nations. Such is the logic of patriotism.	Emma Goldman
Christians tell me that they have a higher destiny than the lower animals, because Homo Sapiens can reason. But the Bible tells me that this gift of reason, which they call god-given, may be the match that lights the fires of hell for all who dare to use it, since whatever is not of faith is sin. 	Ruth Hurmence Green
Suppose you had never heard of Christianity, and that next Sunday morning a stranger standing in a pulpit told you about a book whose authors could not be authenticated and whose contents, written hundreds of years ago, included blood-curdling legends of slaughter and intrigue and fables about unnatural happenings such as virgin births, devils that inhabit bodies and talk, people rising from the dead and ascending live into the clouds, and suns that stand still. Suppose he then asked you to believe that an uneducated man described in that book was a god who could get you into an eternal fantasy-place called heaven, when you die. Would you as an intelligent rational person even bother to read such nonsense, let alone pattern your entire life upon it?	Ruth Hurmence Green
Heresy is only another word for freedom of thought. 	Graham Greene
I am treated as evil by people who claim that they are being oppressed because they are not allowed to force me to practice what they do.	D.Dale Gulledge
We must conduct research and then accept the results. If they don't stand up to experimentation, Buddha's own words must be rejected.	Tenzin Gyatso(the Dalai Lama)
Jesus is just a word I use to swear with.	Richard Harris
I understand prayer quite well. It's a masturbatory exercise that gives catharsis to the pray-er and a placebo effect to the pray-ee, but only if the pray-ee knows he's being prayed for.	John Hattan
If we are going to teach "creation science" as an alternative to evolution, then we should also teach the stork theory as an alternative to biological reproduction. 	Judith Hayes
All religions have based morality on obedience, that is to say, on voluntary slavery. That is why they have always been more pernicious than any political organization. For the latter makes use of violence. the former - of the corruption of the will.	Alexander Herzen
Take away hatred from some people, and you have men without faith.	Erich Hoffer
To know a person's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance.	Erich Hoffer
All children are atheists - they have no idea of God. Baron d'Holbach
Organized religion, being founded on superstition, is, perforce, not scientific. And all that which is not scientific - that is, truthful - must be bolstered up by force, fear and falsehood. Thus we always find slavery and organized religion going hand in hand.	Elbert Hubbard
There is in every village a torch: the schoolmaster - and an extinguisher: the priest.	Victor Hugo
Morality is always the product of terror; its chains and strait-waistcoats are fashioned by those who dare not trust others, because they dare not trust themselves, to walk in liberty.	Aldous Huxley
The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of those of Greece and Rome-not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world, were alike despicable.	Thomas Huxley
The inspiration of the Bible depends on the ignorance of the person who reads it. 	Robert Ingersoll
God so loved the world that he made up his mind to damn a large majority of the human race.	Robert Ingersoll
We are satisfied that there can be but little liberty on earth while men worship a tyrant in heaven.	Robert Ingersoll
As long as every question is answered by the word "God," scientific inquiry is simply impossible.	Robert Ingersoll
My objection to Christianity is that it is infinitely cruel, infinitely selfish, and, I might add, infinitely absurd.	Robert Ingersoll
This crime called blasphemy was invented by priests for the purpose of defending doctrines not able to take care of themselves.	Robert Ingersoll
The notion that faith in Christ is to be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason, observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for refutation, and can be believed only by that unhappy mixture of insanity and ignorance called "faith."	Robert Ingersoll
The real oppressor, enslaver, and corrupter of the people is the Bible. That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy. That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and schools. That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest investigation a crime. That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.	Robert Ingersoll
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.	Samuel Johnson
Few Christians would be in doubt what to think of a father tortured his children for forty-eight hours because they did not agree with him or did not obey him; and if he had a great many children and had given only a few of them a single chance while offering the vast majority no opportunity at all to know his will, most people would consider this the epitome of an inhuman lack of love and justice. The God of traditional Christianity, however, outdoes even this analogy by relegating the mass of mankind to eternal torment.	Walter Kaufmann
You think there is a magic pixie that came from nowhere, made the universe, then tortures people eternally for not believing in it, because it loves them? Does that sum it up?	Steve Knight
The fact is that far more crime and child abuse has been committed by zealots in the name of God, Jesus and Mohammed than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. Many people, including myself, don't like that statement, but the truth of it is undeniable.	Kenneth Lanning
