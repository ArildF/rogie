"""Options

Abstract:

Options.options is a globally shared options object.
This object is initialised when the module is loaded: the envar
BAYESCUSTOMIZE is checked for a list of names, if nothing is found
then the local directory and the home directory are checked for a
file called bayescustomize.ini or .spambayesrc (respectively) and
the initial values are loaded from this.

The Option class is defined in OptionsClass.py - this module
is responsible only for instantiating and loading the globally
shared instance.
